Setup to receive periodic notices from the webserver

1. If pretty URL's are enabled for the website, configure the webserver to call,
   at 15-minute intervals:
    [YOURSITEURL]/cron/send

OR

2. If pretty URL's are NOT enabled for the website:
   i.  First, create a website template containing just
        {content assign='content'}
       which will result in a blank page being displayed 
   ii. Next, create a non-displayed website page, give that page a suitable
       alias, apply the newly-created template, and make the page content
	   just
        {Cron}
   iii. Configure the webserver to call, at 15-minute intervals:
          [YOURSITEURL]/index.php?page=youralias
	    where 'youralias' is the alias of the page just created
